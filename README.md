Built with MOREL, ALAWiT is a resource for readers, writers, publishers, students and teachers interested in Afro-American and Latin American culture in general, and Afro-Latin American culture in particular. It gathers book covers, excerpts, bibliographic clues and digital downloads of works by black Latin American authors in original language and in translation.

The collection is organized by dynamic lists, which group the works according to common characteristics (authors, city of publication, imprint or publisher, nationality of authors, edition date and digital repository). But it also has a search engine that allows you to find works directly.

Today there are approximately 90 books available on ALAWiT, organized by 118 authors, 86 presses and publishers, and 31 repositories. In addition, 31 more works are in progress.

ALAWiT is a scalable platform. And as the amount of metadata being stored grows, and new functionalities are developed, it will allow to know relevant data about this literary corpus.

In this first stage, the archive has been partially fed by the compilations of Mark Sanders, Paulette Ramsay, Antonio D Tillis, Keenan Norris, Idelfonso Pereda Vald√©s and Emilio Vallagas. But the archive is open for users and beneficiaries of the platform to add new content.
